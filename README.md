# Internacionalizador

This application runs in Windows Desktop. It was coded on Visual Basic and helps you on replacing special accents and characters of CSV documents to an international format.

This application takes the directory you manually set on the explorer and start browsing on the folder for CSVs, also, if it finds any subfolder (At any level), it's going to access it looking for more files to process.

After processing the text, it's going to create a new file, which name will be the same original name PLUS the current date in the format YYYYMMDD.
